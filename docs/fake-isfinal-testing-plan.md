# Fake isFinal Feature Testing Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the testing strategy for the new toggleable fake isFinal feature. The feature allows for more responsive transcription by considering speech segments as final after 350ms of silence, rather than waiting for the Web Speech API's native isFinal determination.

## Testing Objectives
1. Verify that the fake isFinal feature can be toggled on and off
2. Confirm that speech segments are appropriately marked as final after 350ms of silence when enabled
3. Ensure translations are processed correctly for both modes
4. Assess performance impact of potentially more frequent speech segment processing
5. Validate user experience improvements in responsiveness

## Test Scenarios

### Feature Toggle Testing
| Test ID | Description | Expected Result |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| TG-01 | Toggle the feature on and off via the settings panel | Feature state changes visually and functionally |
| TG-02 | Refresh the application with feature on | Feature remains off by default |
| TG-03 | Check UI indication of feature state | UI clearly indicates when feature is enabled |
| TG-04 | Show threshold slider when feature is enabled | Threshold slider appears only when feature is on |
| TG-05 | Update threshold with the slider | Threshold value changes when slider is moved |
| TG-06 | Persist settings in localStorage | Settings are saved and restored on refresh |

### Speech Recognition Testing
| Test ID | Description | Expected Result |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| SR-01 | Speak a short phrase with pauses (feature disabled) | Transcript shows only when Web Speech API marks segments as final |
| SR-02 | Speak a short phrase with pauses (feature enabled) | Transcript shows segments as final after configurable pause threshold |
| SR-03 | Speak continuously without pauses (both modes) | Behavior should be similar in both modes |
| SR-04 | Speak with varying pause lengths (shorter, equal to, and longer than threshold) | Only pauses â‰¥ threshold should trigger finalization when enabled |
| SR-05 | Test with different threshold values | Lower threshold should produce more segments, higher threshold fewer segments |

### Translation Testing
| Test ID | Description | Expected Result |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| TR-01 | Speak in source language with feature disabled | Translations appear when native API marks segments as final |
| TR-02 | Speak in source language with feature enabled | Translations appear after 350ms pauses |
| TR-03 | Compare translation quality between modes | Translation quality should be consistent |
| TR-04 | Test with multiple target languages | All target languages receive translations appropriately |

### Performance Testing
| Test ID | Description | Expected Result |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| PF-01 | Monitor CPU usage with feature on vs. off | No significant increase in CPU usage |
| PF-02 | Test with long continuous speech | Application remains responsive |
| PF-03 | Measure time between pause and segment finalization | Should be approximately 350ms when enabled |
| PF-04 | Test with rapid speech with frequent pauses | System should handle increased translation requests |

### User Experience Testing
| Test ID | Description | Expected Result |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| UX-01 | Assess responsiveness improvement perception | Users should notice more responsive transcription |
| UX-02 | Compare lag between speaking and transcript appearance | Reduced lag with feature enabled |
| UX-03 | Test settings panel usability | Settings panel should be intuitive and accessible |
| UX-04 | Test with different speech patterns and accents | Feature should work consistently |

## Testing Environment
- Test in the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, and Safari
- Test on desktop and mobile devices
- Test with different microphones and audio input quality
- Test with different network conditions for translation API calls

## Metrics to Collect
1. Time between end of speech and transcript finalization
2. Number of finalized segments per minute of speech
3. Average length of finalized segments
4. Translation API call frequency
5. User perception of responsiveness (qualitative)

## Threshold Adjustment Testing
Test the configurable threshold with different values:
- 100ms - Most responsive but likely to create many small fragments
- 250ms - More responsive but may create more fragments
- 350ms - Default setting
- 500ms - May reduce fragments but feel less responsive
- 1000ms - Maximum setting, should significantly reduce fragmentation

## Testing Documentation
For each test, document:
- Test ID and description
- Feature toggle state
- Speech input and pattern
- Observed behavior
- Metrics collected
- Issues encountered
- Screenshots or recordings if relevant

## Success Criteria
The feature implementation will be considered successful if:
1. Users perceive improved responsiveness with the feature enabled
2. No degradation in translation quality is observed
3. No significant performance issues are introduced
4. The UI for toggling the feature is intuitive and accessible
